I try to do a project for myself.I use html, css and JavaScript in this project. This project is not good enough. But I will update and include some feature later.
In this project I had take help from Google, Youtube, StackOverflow & some other website. But I was learning new techniques and new code formats and how to do codes
fresh and easy that other person can easily understand my code. My plan is to add 2 or 3 new vanilla JavaScript application in this project for my regular usecase.
